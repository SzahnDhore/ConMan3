**The Convention Manager Evolved**

-------------------------------------------------

A tool written in PHP to help organizing a convention. Primarily written for a gaming convention in Sweden, but should be just as usable for any kind of similar event.

The basic idea is to build a solid system for managing visitors and events at an RPG convention.

**Please note that this is yet work in progress. Many features will have to be written before it's finished and usable.**


## Features

* Twig templating engine to make the authoring of pages simpler.
